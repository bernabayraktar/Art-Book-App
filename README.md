# Art Book App
Art images that we shoot or download to the gallery are drawn into the application by providing permission controls. In the application, information such as name, artist name, production year is added to the images and recorded in the art book. All the art we have saved is displayed on the homepage and we can view the details by clicking on the art name if we wish.
